## üîÑ Complete System Workflow

### Phase 1: Contact Import & Initial Sync
**Frequency**: Every 10 hours (automated via GitHub Actions)

1. **Detection**: System scans designated HubSpot import lists for new contacts
2. **Validation**: Ensures contact data quality (valid emails, required fields)
3. **Transfer**: Copies contacts from HubSpot to Mailchimp
4. **Tagging**: Applies appropriate tags based on contact category

## üè∑Ô∏è How Marketing Teams Use the System

### Tag Application Process
After email campaigns complete, marketing teams review engagement data and apply tags:

1. **Review Campaign Results**: Analyze open rates, click-through rates, replies
2. **Assess Engagement Level**: Determine if contact showed high, medium, or low interest
3. **Apply Appropriate Tags**: Use campaign-specific engagement tags
4. **Sales Handover**: Apply "handover_to_sales" for immediately qualified leads

### Tag Guidelines for Marketing Teams
- **High Engagement ("twice")**: Multiple opens, clicks, replied or showed strong interest
- **Medium Engagement ("once")**: Some opens, limited clicks, moderate interest  
- **Low Engagement ("never")**: Minimal opens, no clicks, little to no engagement
- **Sales Ready**: Direct response, demo request, or clear buying signals

### Timing Considerations
- **Short Campaigns (Recruitment/Competition)**: Tag within 1-2 days of campaign completion
- **Long Campaigns (General/Directors)**: Tag weekly or at campaign milestones
- **System Processing**: Tagged contacts automatically processed every 10 hours

## üîß System Rules & Operations

### Automated Scheduling
- **Sync Frequency**: Every 10 hours via GitHub Actions
- **Processing Time**: Typically completes within 30 minutes
- **Manual Override**: Can be triggered manually when needed

### Data Protection Rules

#### Single Campaign Membership
Each contact can only be in ONE active marketing campaign at a time. The system automatically prevents conflicts by:
- Checking existing campaign membership before adding to new campaigns
- Removing contacts from previous campaigns when moved to sales lists
- Maintaining clear audit trail of contact movement

#### VIP Contact Protection  
Contacts in List 717 (Active Deal Discussions) are automatically excluded from ALL marketing activities to protect ongoing sales conversations.

#### Anti-Remarketing Controls
Once contacts are tagged and moved to sales lists, they are automatically removed from marketing lists to prevent:
- Duplicate messaging between marketing and sales teams
- Customer confusion from multiple outreach streams
- Interference with active sales processes

### Data Flow Monitoring
The system maintains complete tracking of:
- Original contact source (which import list)
- Campaign participation history
- Engagement tag application
- Final destination list placement
- Processing timestamps for audit purposes
