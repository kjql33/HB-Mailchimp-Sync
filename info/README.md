# HubSpot â†’ Mailchimp Sync Agent

A Python-based integration that synchronizes contacts from HubSpot Active Lists to a Mailchimp Audience using the HubSpot CRM v3 Lists API. This tool automates the process of keeping your marketing lists in sync, ensuring consistent communication across platforms.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # OR
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create environment configuration:**
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```bash
   # HubSpot API
   HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_TOKEN=your_hubspot_private_app_token

   # Mailchimp API
   MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_mailchimp_api_key
   MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID=your_mailchimp_audience_id
   MAILCHIMP_DC=your_mailchimp_data_center  # e.g., us20

   # Optional sync parameters (defaults in config.py)
   PAGE_SIZE=20               # Records per HubSpot page
   TEST_CONTACT_LIMIT=0       # 0 = no limit; >0 caps total contacts per list
   MAX_RETRIES=3              # Retry attempts for API calls
   RETRY_DELAY=2              # Delay (seconds) between retries
   REQUIRED_TAGS=COMPANY,CITY,INDUSTRY,PHONE,FNAME,LNAME
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO             # Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   ```

5. **Configure HubSpot lists:**
   Edit the `HUBSPOT_LIST_IDS` list in `config.py` to specify which HubSpot lists to sync.

6. **Run the sync:**
   ```bash
   python sync.py
   ```

## How It Works

The sync agent maintains your Mailchimp audience in perfect alignment with your HubSpot lists through these core operations:

### Single-List Synchronization
1. **Fetch HubSpot Data**: Retrieves list memberships and contact details with pagination
2. **Mailchimp Operations**: Creates/updates contacts, sets status to "subscribed", applies list name as tag
3. **Cleanup**: Removes tags from contacts no longer in the HubSpot list

### Multi-List Management
- Processes each configured HubSpot list independently  
- Contacts in multiple lists receive multiple Mailchimp tags
- Global cleanup archives contacts not present in any tracked list

### Automatic Field Management
- Required merge fields auto-created in Mailchimp if missing
- Data validation and error handling for invalid contacts
- Comprehensive logging and retry mechanisms for reliability

### Core System Rules
1. **Tag Naming**: Mailchimp tags named after HubSpot list names (dynamically fetched)
2. **Multi-List Support**: Contacts can exist in multiple HubSpot lists = multiple Mailchimp tags
3. **Archival Philosophy**: Contacts not in ANY HubSpot list are archived from Mailchimp
4. **Force Subscribe**: All synced contacts forced to "subscribed" status
5. **Merge Field Management**: Required fields auto-created if missing

## System Guarantees & Invariants

### What the System ALWAYS Ensures:
- **Email Uniqueness**: One Mailchimp member per email address
- **Tag Consistency**: List membership accurately reflected in tags
- **Data Freshness**: Mailchimp data updated with latest HubSpot information
- **Status Normalization**: All synced members forced to "subscribed"
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all operations and changes

### What the System NEVER Does:
- **Duplicate Members**: Same email cannot create multiple Mailchimp entries
- **Delete Without Cause**: Members only archived if not in any tracked list
- **Ignore Errors**: All failures logged and tracked for investigation
- **Skip Verification**: Tag application and member status always verified
- **Lose Historical Data**: Operations preserve creation dates and timestamps

## Failure Modes & Recovery

### Recoverable Failures:
- API rate limits (handled with retry logic)
- Temporary network issues (retry with backoff)
- Invalid individual contact data (skip and continue)
- Tag application failures (retry in next sync)

### Non-Recoverable Failures:
- Invalid API credentials (abort entire sync)
- Missing required merge fields that can't be created (abort sync)
- Malformed configuration data (abort with error)
- HubSpot list access permissions issues (skip list, continue others)

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimization Strategies:
- Batch processing for large contact sets
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Configurable rate limiting and delays
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

### Scalability Limits:
- Bounded by Mailchimp API rate limits
- Memory usage scales with largest single list size
- Processing time linear with total contact count
- Storage grows with historical data retention (auto-pruned after 7 days)

## Recent Updates & Improvements

### Tag Renaming Enhancement
**Major Improvement**: Implemented proper tag renaming functionality using Mailchimp's native API instead of the previous inefficient approach.

**Benefits**:
- Instant tag renaming with single API call using `/lists/{list_id}/segments/{tag_id}` endpoint
- Preserves all member associations and segment history
- Maintains Mailchimp's segment timestamps properly
- Includes fallback to previous method if native API fails

### Data Storage Architecture
The system uses a sophisticated file-based storage system for tracking and auditing:

- **`raw_data/metadata/`**: Timestamped HubSpot list metadata snapshots
- **`raw_data/snapshots/`**: Contact and membership data organized by date
- **`list_name_map.json`**: Current list name mapping for change detection
- **`list_name_history.json`**: Complete historical record of all list name changes
- **Retention Policy**: Raw data automatically pruned after 7 days (configurable)

### Workflow Automation
- **Schedule**: Runs every 6 hours via GitHub Actions
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be triggered manually from GitHub Actions tab
- **Error Handling**: Automatic Teams notification on failure
- **CI Integration**: Exits with error code on sync failures
